Hystax is excited to announce a new feature within the OptScale MLOps platform: integrating Databricks account connections.
<br>

Responding to customersâ€™ feedback and committed to enhancing cloud usage efficiency, we have recognized the importance of including Databricks expense tracking in OptScale. This functionality provides a detailed and controlled approach to managing Databricks expenses.
## Feature overview
Integrating Databricks accounts into the Hystax OptScale platform introduces a suite of ML/AI features designed to improve visibility and control over Databricks expenses. Here's a brief overview of the key functionalities:

- Unified experience: The connected Databricks data source is managed in the same familiar way as other data sources in OptScale.
- Cost allocation: OptScale captures metadata from Databricks resources, such as name, tags, and region, enabling effective cost allocation.
- Custom pricing support: If your organization has an agreement with Databricks and uses custom rates for Databricks services, these can be reflected in the connection properties. This alignment ensures the expenses shown in OptScale match your final bill.
